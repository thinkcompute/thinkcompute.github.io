Situations:
* Creating a specific color hue of acrylic paint
* Making bechamel

Common features:
* Different ingredients have to be mixed in together
* There is a specific result desired, in terms of color and consistency
* For the result to be achieved, each ingredient has to be added in specific amounts
* Constant stirring is necessary, and at a specific speed
* Sense of touch, vision, and smell are engaged
