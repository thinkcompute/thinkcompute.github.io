Situations:
* Creating a specific color hue of acrylic paint
* Making bechamel

Common features:
* Different ingredients have to be mixed in together
* There is a specific result desired, in terms of color and consistency
* For the result to be achieved, each ingredient has to be added in specific amounts
* Constant stirring is necessary, and at a specific speed
* Sense of touch, vision, and smell are engaged

Write the table of instructions of a Turing machine with four states – A (initial state), B, C, and D (final state) – such that, once the final state is reached, only the cells immediately on the left and on the right of the initial position of the head of the machine will have the value 1 specified. The final state must not have any instruction set in the table.

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a 0-1 sequence of exactly five symbols and returns 1 if the sequence contains at least three **consecutive** _1s_, and returns 0 otherwise. Implement the algorithm using a Turing machine, with the cell corresponding to the head's starting position storing the final result. Also, the five cells following the starting position of the head are initialised with the 0-1 sequence of five symbols used as input to the algorithm.
